So far, we've used Python and the pandas library to explore and manipulate
individual datasets by hand, much like we would do in a spreadsheet. The beauty
of using a programming language like Python, though, comes from the ability to
automate data processing through the use of loops and functions.


## For loops

Loops allow us to repeat a workflow (or series of actions) a given number of
times or while some condition is true. We would use a loop to automatically
process data that's stored in multiple files (daily values with one file per
year, for example). Loops lighten our work load by performing repeated tasks
without our direct involvement and make it less likely that we'll introduce
errors by making mistakes while processing each file by hand.

Let's write a simple for loop that simulates what a kid might see during a
visit to the zoo:

~~~
animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
print(animals)
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
for creature in animals:
   print(creature)
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
lion
tiger
crocodile
vulture
hippo
~~~
{: .output}

The line defining the loop must start with `for` and end with a colon, and the
body of the loop must be indented.

In this example, `creature` is the loop variable that takes the value of the next
entry in `animals` every time the loop goes around. We can call the loop variable
anything we like. After the loop finishes, the loop variable will still exist
and will have the value of the last entry in the collection:

~~~
animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'crocodile', 'vulture', 'hippo']
for creature in animals:
   pass

print('The loop variable is now: ' + creature)
The loop variable is now: hippo
~~~
{: .source}

We are not asking python to print the value of the loop variable anymore, but
the for loop still runs and the value of `creature` changes on each pass through
the loop. The statement `pass` in the body of the loop just means "do nothing".

{: .challenge}

## Automating data processing using For Loops

The file we've been using so far, `articles.csv`, contains 1 year of data.
We would like to separate the data for each month into a separate file.

Let's start by making a new directory inside the folder `data` to store all of
these files using the module `os`:

~~~
import os

os.mkdir('data/monthly_files')
~~~
{: .source}

The command `os.mkdir` is equivalent to `mkdir` in the shell. Just so we are
sure, we can check that the new directory was created within the `data` folder:

~~~
os.listdir('data')
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
['monthly_files',
 'doajarticlesample.zip',
 'doajarticlesample']

~~~
{: .output}

The command `os.listdir` is equivalent to `ls` in the shell.

In previous lessons, we saw how to use the library pandas to load the species
data into memory as a DataFrame, how to select a subset of the data using some
criteria, and how to write the DataFrame into a csv file. Let's write a script
that performs those three steps in sequence for the month of January:

~~~
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a DataFrame
articles_df = pd.read_csv('articles.csv')

# Select only data for January
articles01 = articles_df[articles_df.Month == 1]

# Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
articles01.to_csv('data/monthly_files/articles01.csv')
~~~
{: .source}

To create monthly data files, we could repeat the last two commands over and
over, once for each month of data. Repeating code is neither elegant nor
practical, and is very likely to introduce errors into your code. We want to
turn what we've just written into a loop that repeats the last two commands for
every month in the dataset.

Let's start by writing a loop that simply prints the names of the files we want
to create - the dataset we are using is one year long and we'll create
a separate file for each month of the year. Listing the filenames is a good way to
confirm that the loop is behaving as we expect.

We have seen that we can loop over a list of items, so we need a list of months
to loop over. We can get the months in our DataFrame with:

~~~
articles_df['Month']
~~~
{: .source}

but we want only unique months, which we can get using the `unique` function
which we have already seen.  

~~~
articles_df['Month'].unique()
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
array([11, 12,  8,  4, 10,  9,  7,  6,  5,  3,  2,  1])
~~~
{: .output}

Of course, we know that years normally have 12 months, so we could be alternatively
use:

~~~
range(1,13)
~~~
{: .source}

Putting this into our for loop we get

~~~
for month in articles_df['Month'].unique():
   filename = 'data/monthly_files/articles{0:02d}.csv'.format(month)
   print(filename)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
data/monthly_files/articles11.csv
data/monthly_files/articles12.csv
data/monthly_files/articles08.csv
data/monthly_files/articles04.csv
data/monthly_files/articles10.csv
data/monthly_files/articles09.csv
data/monthly_files/articles07.csv
data/monthly_files/articles06.csv
data/monthly_files/articles05.csv
data/monthly_files/articles03.csv
data/monthly_files/articles02.csv
data/monthly_files/articles01.csv
~~~
{: .output}

We can now add the rest of the steps we need to create separate text files:

~~~
# Load the data into a DataFrame
for month in articles_df['Month'].unique():
    # Select data for the month
    articles_month = articles_df[articles_df.Month == month]

    # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
    filename = 'data/monthly_files/articles{0:02d}.csv'.format(month)
    articles_month.to_csv(filename)
~~~
{: .source}

Look inside the `monthly_files` directory and check a couple of the files you
just created to confirm that everything worked as expected.

## Writing Unique FileNames

Notice that the code above created a unique filename for each month.

~~~
filename = 'data/monthly_files/articles{0:02d}.csv'.format(month)
~~~
{: .source}

Let's break down the parts of this name:

* The first part is simply some text that specifies the directory to store our
  data file in (data/monthly_files/) and the first part of the file name
  (articles): `'data/monthly_files/articles'`
* The `{0:02d}` part gives us zero padding for our numbers. We specify the number
  we want to fill in using the `.format()` method.
  See [Python str.format() syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)
  for more formatting options.

Notice that we use single quotes to add text strings. The variable is not
surrounded by quotes. This code produces the string
`data/monthly_files/articles01.csv` which contains the path to the new filename
AND the file name itself.

{: .challenge}

## Building reusable and modular code with functions

Suppose that separating large data files into individual monthly files is a task
that we frequently have to perform. We could write a **for loop** like the one above
every time we needed to do it but that would be time consuming and error prone.
A more elegant solution would be to create a reusable tool that performs this
task with minimum input from the user. To do this, we are going to turn the code
we've already written into a function.

Functions are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that are called with a
single command. They can be designed to accept arguments as input and return
values, but they don't need to do either. Variables declared inside functions
only exist while the function is running and if a variable within the function
(a local variable) has the same name as a variable somewhere else in the code,
the local variable hides but doesn't overwrite the other.

Every method used in Python (for example, `print`) is a function, and the
libraries we import (say, `pandas`) are a collection of functions. We will only
use functions that are housed within the same code that uses them, but it's also
easy to write functions that can be used by different programs.

Functions are declared following this general structure:

~~~
def this_is_the_function_name(input_argument1, input_argument2):

    # The body of the function is indented
    # This function prints the two arguments to screen
    print('The function arguments are:', input_argument1, input_argument2, '(this is done inside the function!)')

    # And returns their product
    return input_argument1 * input_argument2
~~~
{: .source}

The function declaration starts with the word `def`, followed by the function
name and any arguments in parenthesis, and ends in a colon. The body of the
function is indented just like loops are. If the function returns something when
it is called, it includes a return statement at the end.

This is how we call the function:

~~~
product_of_inputs = this_is_the_function_name(2,5)
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
The function arguments are: 2 5 (this is done inside the function!)
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
print('Their product is:', product_of_inputs, '(this is done outside the function!)')
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
Their product is: 10 (this is done outside the function!)
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge

> 3. Declare a variable inside the function and test to see where it exists (Hint:

> 4. Explore what happens when a variable both inside and outside the function

>    value of the local variable?
{: .challenge}

We can now turn our code for saving monthly data files into a function. There are
many different "chunks" of this code that we can turn into functions, and we can
even create functions that call other functions inside them. Let's first write a
function that separates data for just one month and saves that data to a file:

~~~
def monthly_csv_writer(this_month, all_data):
    """
    Writes a csv file for data from a given month.

    this_month --- month for which data is extracted
    all_data   --- DataFrame with full-year data
    """

    # Select data for the month
    articles_month = all_data[all_data.Month == this_month]

    # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
    filename = 'data/monthly_files/articles{0:02d}.csv'.format(month)
    articles_month.to_csv(filename)
~~~
{: .source}

The text between the two sets of triple double quotes is called a *docstring* and
contains the documentation for the function. It does nothing when the function
is running and is therefore not necessary, but it is good practice to include
docstrings as a reminder of what the code does. Docstrings in functions also
become part of their 'official' documentation:

~~~
monthly_csv_writer?
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
monthly_csv_writer(2, articles_df)
~~~
{: .source}

We changed the root of the name of the csv file (so it is `function_articles`
instead of `article`) so we can distinguish it from the one we wrote before.
Check the `monthly_files` directory for the file. Did it do what you expect?

What we really want to do, though, is create files for multiple months without
having to request them one by one. Let's write another function that replaces
the entire For loop by simply looping through a sequence of months and repeatedly
calling the function we just wrote, `monthly_csv_writer`:


~~~
def monthly_data_csv_writer(start_month, end_month, all_data):
    """
    Writes separate csv files for each month of data.

    start_month --- the first month of data we want
    end_month --- the last month of data we want
    all_data --- DataFrame with full-year data
    """

    # "end_month" is the last month of data we want to pull, so we loop to end_month+1
    for month in range(start_month, end_month+1):
        monthly_csv_writer(month, all_data)
~~~
{: .source}

Because people will naturally expect that the end month for the files is the last
month with data, the for loop inside the function ends at `end_month + 1`. By
writing the entire loop into a function, we've made a reusable tool for whenever
we need to break a large data file into monthly files. Because we can specify the
first and last month for which we want files, we can even use this function to
create files for a subset of the months available. This is how we call this
function:

~~~
# Load the data into a DataFrame
articles_df = pd.read_csv('data/articles.csv')

# Create csv files
monthly_data_csv_writer(4, 6, articles_df)
~~~
{: .source}

**BEWARE!** If you are using IPython or Jupyter Notebooks and you modify a function, you MUST
re-run that cell in order for the changed function to be available to the rest
of the code. Nothing will visibly happen when you do this, though, because
simply defining a function without *calling* it doesn't produce an output. Any
cells that use the now-changed functions will also have to be re-run for their
output to change.

{: .challenge}

The functions we wrote demand that we give them a value for every argument.
Ideally, we would like these functions to be as flexible and independent as
possible. Let's modify the function `monthly_data_csv_writer` so that the
`start_month` and `end_month` default to the full range of the data if they are
not supplied by the user. Arguments can be given default values with an equal
sign in the function declaration. Any arguments in the function without default
values (here, `all_data`) is a required argument and MUST come before the
argument with default values (which are optional in the function call).

~~~
def monthly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_month=1, end_month=12):
    """
    Modified from monthly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!

    start_month --- the first month of data we want --- default: 1
    end_month --- the last month of data we want --- default: 12
    all_data --- DataFrame with full-year data
    """

    return start_month, end_month


start,end = monthly_data_arg_test (articles_df, 4, 6)
print('Both optional arguments:\t', start, end)

start,end = monthly_data_arg_test (articles_df)
print('Default values:\t\t\t', start, end)
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
Both optional arguments:	4 6
Default values:			1 12
~~~
{: .output}

The "\t" in the `print` statements are tabs, used to make the text align and be
easier to read.

But what if our dataset doesn't start in 1 and end in 12? We can modify the
function so that it looks for the start and end months in the dataset if those
dates are not provided:

~~~
def monthly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_month=None, end_month=None):
    """
    Modified from monthly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!

    start_month --- the first month of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
    end_month --- the last month of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
    all_data --- DataFrame with full-year data
    """

    if not start_month:
        start_month = min(all_data.Month)
    if not end_month:
        end_month = max(all_data.Month)

    return start_month, end_month


start,end = monthly_data_arg_test (articles_df, 4, 6)
print('Both optional arguments:\t', start, end)

start,end = monthly_data_arg_test (articles_df)
print('Default values:\t\t\t', start, end)
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
Both optional arguments:	4 6
Default values:			1 12
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge
> We got the same result because our data set does start with 1 and end with 12.

{: .challenge}

The default values of the `start_month` and `end_month` arguments in the function
`monthly_data_arg_test` are now `None`. This is a built in constant in Python
that indicates the absence of a value - essentially, that the variable exists in
the namespace of the function (the directory of variable names) but that it
doesn't correspond to any existing object.

> ## Challenge

{: .challenge}

The body of the test function now has two conditional statements (`if` statements) that
check the values of `start_month` and `end_month`. `if` statements execute the body of
the statement when some condition is met. They commonly look something like this:

~~~
a = 5

if a < 0: # meets first condition?

    # if a IS less than zero
    print('a is a negative number')

elif a > 0: # did not meet first condition. meets second condition?

    # if a ISN'T less than zero and IS more than zero
    print('a is a positive number')

else: # met neither condition

    # if a ISN'T less than zero and ISN'T more than zero
    print('a must be zero!')

a is a positive number
~~~
{: .source}

Change the value of `a` to see how this function works. The statement `elif`
means "else if", and all of the conditional statements must end in a colon.

The `if` statements in the function `monthly_data_arg_test` check whether there is an
object associated with the variable names `start_month` and `end_month`. If those
variables are `None`, the if statements return the boolean `True` and execute whatever
is in their body. On the other hand, if the variable names are associated with
some value (they got a number in the function call), the `if` statements return `False`
and do not execute. The opposite conditional statements, which would return
`True` if the variables were associated with objects (if they had received value
in the function call), would be `if start_month` and `if end_month`.

As we've written it so far, the function `monthly_data_arg_test` associates
values in the function call with arguments in the function definition just based
in their order. If the function gets only two values in the function call, the
first one will be associated with `all_data` and the second with `start_month`,
regardless of what we intended them to be. We can get around this problem by
calling the function using keyword arguments, where each of the arguments in the
function definition is associated with a keyword and the function call passes
values to the function using these keywords:

~~~

    """

    if not start_month:
        start_month = min(all_data.Month)

    return start_month, end_month
